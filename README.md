# Goo

Yet another JS Front-End framework.

This one is focused on generating tiny single-HTML applications for embedded systems, preferably without depending on any CDN, for offline use.

It uses [webpack]() to build native [WebComponents]() from a vue-like SFC syntax.
It attempts to solve basic issues with the interaction between JS and DOM, in order to make the development with vanilla JS/HTML5 more fluid. Nothing else.
